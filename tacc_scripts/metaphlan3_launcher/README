This directory has scripts to help orchestrate metaphlan3 for the COVIRT project.  

Below is a list of files with an explanation of their contents:

etl.sh - Not intended to be run directly.  It contains some templates for taking a list of all the files that need to be processed, making required subdirectories, and generating a list of commands that need to be run.

metaphlan3_workflow.sh - Runs the metaphlan3 pipeline scripted by Michael Jochum at Baylor College of Medicine.  The input files and other parameters are passed in as command line arguments.  Try "./metaphlan3_workflow.sh -h" for more information.

launcher.slurm - an example job submission script that will take a list of commands and run them in parallel using all available nodes in the job.  "module help launcher" has more info on the launcher tool.
